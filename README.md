# Jester Weather
https://fadingmorsecode.github.io/weather-app/
# Project Summary:
Jester Weather is a weather forecast site that can search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celcius. It uses API from https://www.weatherapi.com/ and https://developers.giphy.com/ to retrieve weather data and show a background that loosely matches the current weather condition. I have also used https://date-fns.org/ to parse and format the dates. 
# Goals:
* Utilize public API(s)
* Use a loading component while waiting on data
* Display both current and forecast weather
* Change the look of the page based on the weather data
# In Action:

# Reflection:
The weather app is a fun project to practice asynchronous and API skills. I found everything to be straightforward and did not have any instances of being stuck for a long time. While I could have displayed more data retrieved from the API, this is not a project that would necessarily be "portfolio worthy". Async and await are really nice to use and I am glad that I can now harness some of that power. Overall, I am pleased with my solution to the project goals and am looking forward to more asynchronous coding.
